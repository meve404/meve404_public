This website was created to show my projects. It was made with Django and python to make the back end. The website has the possibility to add, delete, and create projects using the admin panel of Django. The Frontend was made with Bootstrap 5, HTML 5, and CSS 3. It was deployed to an Ubuntu server using Ngnix, and Gunicorn, and the database was built with PostgreSQL.
